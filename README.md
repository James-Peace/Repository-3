# Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
How to create lists from a file. This of course is the simplistic way of describing the tasks. Learning how to read a file, format the information into lists, store those lists and be able to search those lists.
Then diplsy that information in a readable manner. The second part of this question is to determine which types of lists are the most efficient for memory for the specific project.
THis is the part I struggled with the most. I never did really figure out how to use a runtime analysis to determine which type of lists I should use for which type of projects.
In the end I used the Binary tree because I found it to be the easiest of the several types to write. It was also the second fastest compiling in the module projects. 
I'm still unsure of the benefits and drawbacks of using each type of list, and I definitely need to study more on the topic.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
As I said above, in the end I used the module projects to determine which type I would use for the final project. This is very important for me to figure out because data structures are in everything
we do in a computer program. From MYSQL, server Databases, to the basic file structures used to store information. Knowing what type of structure to use is important. At work, I look at the file structures
on a near daily basis in order to find certain files to inspect in order to diagnose failing systems. Knowing which structures work best for each type of system that your running is extrememly important
to the speed of the system and the readability of the data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
Most of my roadblocks this term were honestly due to exterior forces. In order to overcome these, I simply forced the objective. Travelling for work these past couple months was very trying on my time
available to work on thiese issues. Being without internet for days on end, I would simply find whatever time and whatever internet I had available to read, and practice with the code. When I did 
run into problems understanding the code, or determining what I was doing wrong, I leaned on other resources to help me out. A guy from work was an incredible help on a couple of these projects.
One in particular. We were stuck in an wirport for about 5 hours in the middle of the night, and I handed him my laptop and asked him to help me get unstuck. He looked through my code and told me that 
I could lose probably 10 lines of code to accomplish the same thing. Then handed my laptop back to me and didn't tell me where I could lose that code (What a turd). Luckily, he wanted me to figure it out.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This has given me more practice for sure. I'm learning how to clean up my code, perhaps not write as messy of code, simplify some things and look at the overall code differently. I found myself really
trying to understand the parser files to figure out exatly how they worked. I also have learned that creating psuedocode is not my strongpoint at all. I can see in my head what needs to be done, but
putting that into pseudocode is not an easy task for me somehow. I also learned that I have a hard time starting the program itself. If I had to write this program completely from scratch right now,
I'm not sure I would really know how to start. Having the references from the previous modules was a need for me. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I'm not entirely sure if I have been able to evolve much in this realm over this term. I was able to copy/paste wuite a bit of my previous code into project 2, and simply adapt it a bit to achieve the 
end goals. Several functions were pretty similar, and this made it a bit streamlined for me to get the code working. I learned in previous courses to minimize my Main() function, so doing that is
pretty simple at this point, but setting the structure for the rest of the program is something I definitley need to get better at. 

Hopefully I will be able to dedicate more time to future courses; especially the more advanced courses that I have remaining in this adventure. There have been many nights of low sleep, late nights, 
and even falling alseep on my laptop one night. This was due to broken eqipment at work and many hours of travel to fix them. It's an unfortunate part of adult life, trying to begin a new career at this age.
I'm hoping this winter is much like last year was, and it is a pretty quiet season at work. THis past three and a half months have been rough. 

Thank you for the incites, the critiques, and the acknowledgments of things done right.
